## Overview
NoteMe is a web-based blogging platform that enables users to express and share their thoughts online. The application features core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage their blog posts through basic operations. While currently in its initial version with simple paragraph-based posts and without pagination or session management, the app showcases an innovative technical implementation. What makes this project noteworthy is its architecture - it combines Next.js with Hono.js using edge runtime on Cloudflare Workers, resulting in exceptionally fast API performance. This marks my first venture into full-stack development, focusing on demonstrating the powerful synergy between these modern web technologies.
